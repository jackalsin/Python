Is there any improvement you want to make in terms of the format of query string, the user interaction in the HTML webpage, the approaches for querying different keywords, etc.? Please discuss your findings and propose new ideas if you have any to improve the software design.

1. Improvement:<br>
    I did some type check for the query in case of any type miss any error.<br>
2. Ones I want to improve:<br>
    2.1 the front end should do the type check<br>
    2.2 the backend should do defensive copy<br>
    2.3 the front end should provide dropdown list for user to give hints
    2.4 Change a fromework to Node js -> a lot faster and can use json to do the type check.
