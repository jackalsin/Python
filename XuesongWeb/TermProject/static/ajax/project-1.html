		<h2>Connect 4</h2>
		<p>Connect Four (also known as Captain's Mistress, Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Fourplay[citation needed],
            Four in a Row, Four in a Line and Gravitrips (in Soviet Union) ) is a two-player connection game in which
            the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a seven-column
            , six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space
            within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal,
            vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can
            always win by playing the right moves.
The game was first sold under the famous Connect Four trademark by Milton Bradley in February 1974.</p>
